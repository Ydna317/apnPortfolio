### Updated Portfolio

One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio. You should also add two more Challenge assignments that you’re proud of, so that your portfolio includes your two deployed projects and two to four deployed Challenges. You may have opted to use the solution code that you received for your Module 2 Challenge as a template for your portfolio. Alternatively, you could create your own as you complete this course.

Make sure that your portfolio includes the following:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn page, as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects, including the following details for each one:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

Your site should look polished. Refer to the following guidelines in particular:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette for your site so that it doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Ensure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Professional Materials

You should update your professional materials again, including the following:


#### Update Your GitHub Profile

If you haven't yet, update the following in your GitHub profile:

* Profile picture

* Bio

* Location

* Email

* Link to your portfolio

Employers and potential collaborators will look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward!

You’ll also want to pin some repos that you want to highlight. To do this, navigate to GitHub, go to your profile, and do the following:

1. Click "Customize your pins".

2. Click the checkboxes for your projects and two to four Challenge assignments that you want to share.

3. Check that each of these projects is deployed, and add a link to the deployed project in the README file.

4. Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network, and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is about writing code.

#### Update Your Resume

Update your resume with the skills you’ve learned since the first group project. Make sure that you have a clear, concise, and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you’re looking for.

#### Update Your LinkedIn Profile

Update your LinkedIn profile with your new skills and technologies and make sure that you include a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github profile and portfolio.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Missing Number

- Coding Algorithm #2: Left Rotation

- Coding Algorithm #3: Ransom Note
